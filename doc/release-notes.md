How to Upgrade
==============


Performance Improvements
--------------

Validation speed and network propagation performance have been greatly
improved, leading to much shorter sync and initial block download times.

- The script signature cache has been reimplemented as a "cuckoo cache",
  allowing for more signatures to be cached and faster lookups.
- Assumed-valid blocks have been introduced which allows script validation to
  be skipped for ancestors of known-good blocks, without changing the security
  model. See below for more details.
- In some cases, compact blocks are now relayed before being fully validated as
  per BIP152.
- P2P networking has been refactored with a focus on concurrency and
  throughput. Network operations are no longer bottlenecked by validation. As a
  result, block fetching is several times faster than previous releases in many
  cases.
- The UTXO cache now claims unused mempool memory. This speeds up initial block
  download as UTXO lookups are a major bottleneck there, and there is no use for
  the mempool at that stage.


Manual Pruning
--------------

DigiByte Core has supported automatically pruning the blockchain since 0.11. Pruning
the blockchain allows for significant storage space savings as the vast majority of
the downloaded data can be discarded after processing so very little of it remains
on the disk.

Manual block pruning can now be enabled by setting `-prune=1`. Once that is set,
the RPC command `pruneblockchain` can be used to prune the blockchain up to the
specified height or timestamp.

`getinfo` Deprecated
--------------------

The `getinfo` RPC command has been deprecated. Each field in the RPC call
has been moved to another command's output with that command also giving
additional information that `getinfo` did not provide. The following table
shows where each field has been moved to:

|`getinfo` field   | Moved to                                  |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
`"version"`	   | `getnetworkinfo()["version"]`
`"protocolversion"`| `getnetworkinfo()["protocolversion"]`
`"walletversion"`  | `getwalletinfo()["walletversion"]`
`"balance"`	   | `getwalletinfo()["balance"]`
`"blocks"`	   | `getblockchaininfo()["blocks"]`
`"timeoffset"`	   | `getnetworkinfo()["timeoffset"]`
`"connections"`	   | `getnetworkinfo()["connections"]`
`"proxy"`	   | `getnetworkinfo()["networks"][0]["proxy"]`
`"difficulty"`	   | `getblockchaininfo()["difficulty"]`
`"testnet"`	   | `getblockchaininfo()["chain"] == "test"`
`"keypoololdest"`  | `getwalletinfo()["keypoololdest"]`
`"keypoolsize"`	   | `getwalletinfo()["keypoolsize"]`
`"unlocked_until"` | `getwalletinfo()["unlocked_until"]`
`"paytxfee"`	   | `getwalletinfo()["paytxfee"]`
`"relayfee"`	   | `getnetworkinfo()["relayfee"]`
`"errors"`	   | `getnetworkinfo()["warnings"]`

ZMQ On Windows
--------------

Previously the ZeroMQ notification system was unavailable on Windows
due to various issues with ZMQ. These have been fixed upstream and
now ZMQ can be used on Windows. Please see [this document](https://github.com/digibyte/digibyte/blob/master/doc/zmq.md) for
help with using ZMQ in general.

Nested RPC Commands in Debug Console
------------------------------------

The ability to nest RPC commands has been added to the debug console. This
allows users to have the output of a command become the input to another
command without running the commands separately.

The nested RPC commands use bracket syntax (i.e. `getwalletinfo()`) and can
be nested (i.e. `getblock(getblockhash(1))`). Simple queries can be
done with square brackets where object values are accessed with either an 
array index or a non-quoted string (i.e. `listunspent()[0][txid]`). Both
commas and spaces can be used to separate parameters in both the bracket syntax
and normal RPC command syntax.

Network Activity Toggle
-----------------------

A RPC command and GUI toggle have been added to enable or disable all p2p
network activity. The network status icon in the bottom right hand corner 
is now the GUI toggle. Clicking the icon will either enable or disable all
p2p network activity. If network activity is disabled, the icon will 
be grayed out with an X on top of it.

Additionally the `setnetworkactive` RPC command has been added which does
the same thing as the GUI icon. The command takes one boolean parameter,
`true` enables networking and `false` disables it.

Out-of-sync Modal Info Layer
----------------------------

When DigiByte Core is out-of-sync on startup, a semi-transparent information
layer will be shown over top of the normal display. This layer contains
details about the current sync progress and estimates the amount of time
remaining to finish syncing. This layer can also be hidden and subsequently
unhidden by clicking on the progress bar at the bottom of the window.

Support for JSON-RPC Named Arguments
------------------------------------

Commands sent over the JSON-RPC interface and through the `digibyte-cli` binary
can now use named arguments. This follows the [JSON-RPC specification](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification)
for passing parameters by-name with an object.

`digibyte-cli` has been updated to support this by parsing `name=value` arguments
when the `-named` option is given.

Some examples:

    src/digibyte-cli -named help command="help"
    src/digibyte-cli -named getblockhash height=0
    src/digibyte-cli -named getblock blockhash=000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f
    src/digibyte-cli -named sendtoaddress address="(snip)" amount="1.0" subtractfeefromamount=true

The order of arguments doesn't matter in this case. Named arguments are also
useful to leave out arguments that should stay at their default value. The
rarely-used arguments `comment` and `comment_to` to `sendtoaddress`, for example, can
be left out. However, this is not yet implemented for many RPC calls, this is
expected to land in a later release.

The RPC server remains fully backwards compatible with positional arguments.

Opt into RBF When Sending
-------------------------

A new startup option, `-walletrbf`, has been added to allow users to have all
transactions sent opt into RBF support. The default value for this option is
currently `false`, so transactions will not opt into RBF by default. The new
`bumpfee` RPC can be used to replace transactions that opt into RBF.

Sensitive Data Is No Longer Stored In Debug Console History
-----------------------------------------------------------

The debug console maintains a history of previously entered commands that can be
accessed by pressing the Up-arrow key so that users can easily reuse previously
entered commands. Commands which have sensitive information such as passphrases and
private keys will now have a `(...)` in place of the parameters when accessed through
the history.

Retaining the Mempool Across Restarts
-------------------------------------

The mempool will be saved to the data directory prior to shutdown
to a `mempool.dat` file. This file preserves the mempool so that when the node
restarts the mempool can be filled with transactions without waiting for new transactions
to be created. This will also preserve any changes made to a transaction through
commands such as `prioritisetransaction` so that those changes will not be lost.

Final Alert
-----------

The Alert System was [disabled and deprecated](https://digibyte.org/en/alert/2016-11-01-alert-retirement) in DigiByte Core 0.12.1 and removed in 0.13.0. 
The Alert System was retired with a maximum sequence final alert which causes any nodes
supporting the Alert System to display a static hard-coded "Alert Key Compromised" message which also
prevents any other alerts from overriding it. This final alert is hard-coded into this release
so that all old nodes receive the final alert.

GUI Changes
-----------

 - After resetting the options by clicking the `Reset Options` button 
   in the options dialog or with the `-resetguioptions` startup option, 
   the user will be prompted to choose the data directory again. This 
   is to ensure that custom data directories will be kept after the 
   option reset which clears the custom data directory set via the choose 
   datadir dialog.

 - Multiple peers can now be selected in the list of peers in the debug 
   window. This allows for users to ban or disconnect multiple peers 
   simultaneously instead of banning them one at a time.

 - An indicator has been added to the bottom right hand corner of the main
   window to indicate whether the wallet being used is a HD wallet. This
   icon will be grayed out with an X on top of it if the wallet is not a
   HD wallet.

Low-level RPC changes
----------------------

 - `importprunedfunds` only accepts two required arguments. Some versions accept
   an optional third arg, which was always ignored. Make sure to never pass more
   than two arguments.

 - The first boolean argument to `getaddednodeinfo` has been removed. This is 
   an incompatible change.

 - RPC command `getmininginfo` loses the "testnet" field in favor of the more
   generic "chain" (which has been present for years).

 - A new RPC command `preciousblock` has been added which marks a block as
   precious. A precious block will be treated as if it were received earlier
   than a competing block.

 - A new RPC command `importmulti` has been added which receives an array of 
   JSON objects representing the intention of importing a public key, a 
   private key, an address and script/p2sh

 - Use of `getrawtransaction` for retrieving confirmed transactions with unspent
   outputs has been deprecated. For now this will still work, but in the future
   it may change to only be able to retrieve information about transactions in
   the mempool or if `txindex` is enabled.

 - A new RPC command `getmemoryinfo` has been added which will return information
   about the memory usage of DigiByte Core. This was added in conjunction with
   optimizations to memory management. See [Pull #8753](https://github.com/digibyte/digibyte/pull/8753)
   for more information.

 - A new RPC command `bumpfee` has been added which allows replacing an
   unconfirmed wallet transaction that signaled RBF (see the `-walletrbf`
   startup option above) with a new transaction that pays a higher fee, and
   should be more likely to get confirmed quickly.

HTTP REST Changes
-----------------

 - UTXO set query (`GET /rest/getutxos/<checkmempool>/<txid>-<n>/<txid>-<n>
   /.../<txid>-<n>.<bin|hex|json>`) responses were changed to return status 
   code `HTTP_BAD_REQUEST` (400) instead of `HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` (500)
   when requests contain invalid parameters.

Minimum Fee Rate Policies
-------------------------

Since the changes in 0.12 to automatically limit the size of the mempool and improve the performance of block creation in mining code it has not been important for relay nodes or miners to set `-minrelaytxfee`. With this release the following concepts that were tied to this option have been separated out:
- incremental relay fee used for calculating BIP 125 replacement and mempool limiting. (1000 satoshis/kB)
- calculation of threshold for a dust output. (effectively 3 * 1000 satoshis/kB)
- minimum fee rate of a package of transactions to be included in a block created by the mining code. If miners wish to set this minimum they can use the new `-blockmintxfee` option.  (defaults to 1000 satoshis/kB)

The `-minrelaytxfee` option continues to exist but is recommended to be left unset.

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely

shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/DigiByte-Qt` (on Mac)
or `digibyted`/`digibyte-qt` (on Linux).

If your node has a txindex, the txindex db will be migrated the first time you run 0.17.0 or newer, which may take up to a few hours. Your node will not be functional until this migration completes.

The first time you run version 0.15.0 or newer, your chainstate database will be converted to a
new format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour,
depending on the speed of your machine.

Note that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no
automatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0 or higher. Upgrading
directly from 0.7.x and earlier without re-downloading the blockchain is not supported.
However, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.

Wallet changes
---------------


### Segwit Wallet

DigiByte Core 0.16.0 introduces full support for segwit in the wallet and user interfaces. A new `-addresstype` argument has been added, which supports `legacy`, `p2sh-segwit` (default), and `bech32` addresses. It controls what kind of addresses are produced by `getnewaddress`, `getaccountaddress`, and `createmultisigaddress`. A `-changetype` argument has also been added, with the same options, and by default equal to `-addresstype`, to control which kind of change is used.

A new `address_type` parameter has been added to the `getnewaddress` and `addmultisigaddress` RPCs to specify which type of address to generate.
A `change_type` argument has been added to the `fundrawtransaction` RPC to override the `-changetype` argument for specific transactions.

- All segwit addresses created through `getnewaddress` or `*multisig` RPCs explicitly get their redeemscripts added to the wallet file. This means that downgrading after creating a segwit address will work, as long as the wallet file is up to date.
- All segwit keys in the wallet get an implicit redeemscript added, without it being written to the file. This means recovery of an old backup will work, as long as you use new software.
- All keypool keys that are seen used in transactions explicitly get their redeemscripts added to the wallet files. This means that downgrading after recovering from a backup that includes a segwit address will work

Note that some RPCs do not yet support segwit addresses. Notably, `signmessage`/`verifymessage` doesn't support segwit addresses, nor does `importmulti` at this time. `dumpwallet`/`importwallet` work, but will (in comments) list the corresponding P2PKH addresses for all keys, even those only used in segwit addresses. Support for segwit in those RPCs will continue to be added in future versions.

P2WPKH change outputs are now used by default if any destination in the transaction is a P2WPKH or P2WSH output. This is done to ensure the change output is as indistinguishable from the other outputs as possible in either case.

### BIP173 (Bech32) Address support ("bc1..." addresses)

Full support for native segwit addresses (BIP173 / Bech32) has now been added.
This includes the ability to send to BIP173 addresses (including non-v0 ones), and generating these
addresses (including as default new addresses, see above).

A checkbox has been added to the GUI to select whether a Bech32 address or P2SH-wrapped address should be generated when using segwit addresses. When launched with `-addresstype=bech32` it is checked by default. When launched with `-addresstype=legacy` it is unchecked and disabled.

### HD-wallets by default

Due to a backward-incompatible change in the wallet database, wallets created
with version 0.16.0 will be rejected by previous versions. Also, version 0.16.0
will only create hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets.

### Replace-By-Fee by default in GUI

The send screen now uses BIP125 RBF by default, regardless of `-walletrbf`.
There is a checkbox to mark the transaction as final.

The RPC default remains unchanged: to use RBF, launch with `-walletrbf=1` or
use the `replaceable` argument for individual transactions.

### Wallets directory configuration (`-walletdir`)

DigiByte Core now has more flexibility in where the wallets directory can be
located. Previously wallet database files were stored at the top level of the
digibyte data directory. The behavior is now:

- For new installations (where the data directory doesn't already exist),
  wallets will now be stored in a new `wallets/` subdirectory inside the data
  directory by default.
- For existing nodes (where the data directory already exists), wallets will be
  stored in the data directory root by default. If a `wallets/` subdirectory
  already exists in the data directory root, then wallets will be stored in the
  `wallets/` subdirectory by default.
- The location of the wallets directory can be overridden by specifying a
  `-walletdir=<path>` option where `<path>` can be an absolute path to a
  directory or directory symlink.

Care should be taken when choosing the wallets directory location, as if it
becomes unavailable during operation, funds may be lost.

Build: Minimum GCC bumped to 4.8.x
------------------------------------
The minimum version of the GCC compiler required to compile DigiByte Core is now 4.8. No effort will be
made to support older versions of GCC. See discussion in issue #11732 for more information.
The minimum version for the Clang compiler is still 3.3. Other minimum dependency versions can be found in `doc/dependencies.md` in the repository.

Support for signalling pruned nodes (BIP159)
---------------------------------------------
Pruned nodes can now signal BIP159's NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED using service bits, in preparation for
full BIP159 support in later versions. This would allow pruned nodes to serve the most recent blocks. However, the current change does not yet include support for connecting to these pruned peers.

Performance: SHA256 assembly enabled by default
-------------------------------------------------
The SHA256 hashing optimizations for architectures supporting SSE4, which lead to ~50% speedups in SHA256 on supported hardware (~5% faster synchronization and block validation), have now been enabled by default. In previous versions they were enabled using the `--enable-experimental-asm` flag when building, but are now the default and no longer deemed experimental.

GUI changes
-----------
- Uses of "µDGB" in the GUI now also show the more colloquial term "bits", specified in BIP176.
- The option to reuse a previous address has now been removed. This was justified by the need to "resend" an invoice, but now that we have the request history, that need should be gone.
- Support for searching by TXID has been added, rather than just address and label.
- A "Use available balance" option has been added to the send coins dialog, to add the remaining available wallet balance to a transaction output.
- A toggle for unblinding the password fields on the password dialog has been added.
=======
From 0.17.0 onwards macOS <10.10 is no longer supported. 0.17.0 is built using Qt 5.9.x, which doesn't
support versions of macOS older than 10.10.
=======
From DigiByte Core 22.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.14 are no longer supported.

Notable changes
===============

P2P and network changes
-----------------------

- This release removes support for Tor version 2 hidden services in favor of Tor
  v3 only, as the Tor network [dropped support for Tor
  v2](https://blog.torproject.org/v2-deprecation-timeline) with the release of
  Tor version 0.4.6.  Henceforth, DigiByte Core ignores Tor v2 addresses; it
  neither rumors them over the network to other peers, nor stores them in memory
  or to `peers.dat`.  (#22050)

- Added NAT-PMP port mapping support via
  [`libnatpmp`](https://miniupnp.tuxfamily.org/libnatpmp.html). (#18077)

Updated RPCs
------------
>>>>>>> bitcoin/8.22.0

- Due to [BIP 350](https://github.com/digibyte/bips/blob/master/bip-0350.mediawiki)
  being implemented, behavior for all RPCs that accept addresses is changed when
  a native witness version 1 (or higher) is passed. These now require a Bech32m
  encoding instead of a Bech32 one, and Bech32m encoding will be used for such
  addresses in RPC output as well. No version 1 addresses should be created
  for mainnet until consensus rules are adopted that give them meaning
  (e.g. through [BIP 341](https://github.com/digibyte/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki)).
  Once that happens, Bech32m is expected to be used for them, so this shouldn't
  affect any production systems, but may be observed on other networks where such
  addresses already have meaning (like signet). (#20861)

- The `getpeerinfo` RPC returns two new boolean fields, `bip152_hb_to` and
  `bip152_hb_from`, that respectively indicate whether we selected a peer to be
  in compact blocks high-bandwidth mode or whether a peer selected us as a
  compact blocks high-bandwidth peer. High-bandwidth peers send new block
  announcements via a `cmpctblock` message rather than the usual inv/headers
  announcements. See BIP 152 for more details. (#19776)

- `getpeerinfo` no longer returns the following fields: `addnode`, `banscore`,
  and `whitelisted`, which were previously deprecated in 0.21. Instead of
  `addnode`, the `connection_type` field returns manual. Instead of
  `whitelisted`, the `permissions` field indicates if the peer has special
  privileges. The `banscore` field has simply been removed. (#20755)

- The following RPCs:  `gettxout`, `getrawtransaction`, `decoderawtransaction`,
  `decodescript`, `gettransaction`, and REST endpoints: `/rest/tx`,
  `/rest/getutxos`, `/rest/block` deprecated the following fields (which are no
  longer returned in the responses by default): `addresses`, `reqSigs`.
  The `-deprecatedrpc=addresses` flag must be passed for these fields to be
  included in the RPC response. This flag/option will be available only for this major release, after which
  the deprecation will be removed entirely. Note that these fields are attributes of
  the `scriptPubKey` object returned in the RPC response. However, in the response
  of `decodescript` these fields are top-level attributes, and included again as attributes
  of the `scriptPubKey` object. (#20286)

- When creating a hex-encoded digibyte transaction using the `digibyte-tx` utility
  with the `-json` option set, the following fields: `addresses`, `reqSigs` are no longer
  returned in the tx output of the response. (#20286)

- The `listbanned` RPC now returns two new numeric fields: `ban_duration` and `time_remaining`.
  Respectively, these new fields indicate the duration of a ban and the time remaining until a ban expires,
  both in seconds. Additionally, the `ban_created` field is repositioned to come before `banned_until`. (#21602)

- The `getnodeaddresses` RPC now returns a "network" field indicating the
  network type (ipv4, ipv6, onion, or i2p) for each address.  (#21594)

- `getnodeaddresses` now also accepts a "network" argument (ipv4, ipv6, onion,
  or i2p) to return only addresses of the specified network.  (#21843)

- The `testmempoolaccept` RPC now accepts multiple transactions (still experimental at the moment,
  API may be unstable). This is intended for testing transaction packages with dependency
  relationships; it is not recommended for batch-validating independent transactions. In addition to
  mempool policy, package policies apply: the list cannot contain more than 25 transactions or have a
  total size exceeding 101K virtual bytes, and cannot conflict with (spend the same inputs as) each other or
  the mempool, even if it would be a valid BIP125 replace-by-fee. There are some known limitations to
  the accuracy of the test accept: it's possible for `testmempoolaccept` to return "allowed"=True for a
  group of transactions, but "too-long-mempool-chain" if they are actually submitted. (#20833)

- `addmultisigaddress` and `createmultisig` now support up to 20 keys for
  Segwit addresses. (#20867)

- Passing an invalid `-rpcauth` argument now cause digibyted to fail to start.  (#20461)

Tools and Utilities
-------------------

- A new CLI `-addrinfo` command returns the number of addresses known to the
  node per network type (including Tor v2 versus v3) and total. This can be
  useful to see if the node knows enough addresses in a network to use options
  like `-onlynet=<network>` or to upgrade to this release of DigiByte Core 22.0
  that supports Tor v3 only.  (#21595)

- A new `-rpcwaittimeout` argument to `digibyte-cli` sets the timeout
  in seconds to use with `-rpcwait`. If the timeout expires,
  `digibyte-cli` will report a failure. (#21056)

Wallet
------

- A new `listdescriptors` RPC is available to inspect the contents of descriptor-enabled wallets.
  The RPC returns public versions of all imported descriptors, including their timestamp and flags.
  For ranged descriptors, it also returns the range boundaries and the next index to generate addresses from. (#20226)

- The `bumpfee` RPC is not available with wallets that have private keys
  disabled. `psbtbumpfee` can be used instead. (#20891)

- The `fundrawtransaction`, `send` and `walletcreatefundedpsbt` RPCs now support an `include_unsafe` option
  that when `true` allows using unsafe inputs to fund the transaction.
  Note that the resulting transaction may become invalid if one of the unsafe inputs disappears.
  If that happens, the transaction must be funded with different inputs and republished. (#21359)

- We now support up to 20 keys in `multi()` and `sortedmulti()` descriptors
  under `wsh()`. (#20867)

Low-level changes
=================

RPC
---

- The RPC server can process a limited number of simultaneous RPC requests.
  Previously, if this limit was exceeded, the RPC server would respond with
  [status code 500 (`HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#5xx_server_errors).
  Now it returns status code 503 (`HTTP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`). (#18335)

- Error codes have been updated to be more accurate for the following error cases (#18466):
  - `signmessage` now returns RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY (-5) if the
    passed address is invalid. Previously returned RPC_TYPE_ERROR (-3).
  - `verifymessage` now returns RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY (-5) if the
    passed address is invalid. Previously returned RPC_TYPE_ERROR (-3).
  - `verifymessage` now returns RPC_TYPE_ERROR (-3) if the passed signature
    is malformed. Previously returned RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY (-5).

- The `createrawtransaction` RPC will now accept an array or dictionary (kept for compatibility) for the `outputs` parameter. This means the order of transaction outputs can be specified by the client.
- The `fundrawtransaction` RPC will reject the previously deprecated `reserveChangeKey` option.
- `sendmany` now shuffles outputs to improve privacy, so any previously expected behavior with regards to output ordering can no longer be relied upon.
- The new RPC `testmempoolaccept` can be used to test acceptance of a transaction to the mempool without adding it.
- JSON transaction decomposition now includes a `weight` field which provides
  the transaction's exact weight. This is included in REST /rest/tx/ and
  /rest/block/ endpoints when in json mode. This is also included in `getblock`
  (with verbosity=2), `listsinceblock`, `listtransactions`, and
  `getrawtransaction` RPC commands.
- New `fees` field introduced in `getrawmempool`, `getmempoolancestors`, `getmempooldescendants` and
   `getmempoolentry` when verbosity is set to `true` with sub-fields `ancestor`, `base`, `modified`
   and `descendant` denominated in BTC. This new field deprecates previous fee fields, such as
   `fee`, `modifiedfee`, `ancestorfee` and `descendantfee`.
- The new RPC `getzmqnotifications` returns information about active ZMQ
  notifications.

External wallet files
---------------------

The `-wallet=<path>` option now accepts full paths instead of requiring wallets
to be located in the -walletdir directory.

Newly created wallet format
---------------------------

If `-wallet=<path>` is specified with a path that does not exist, it will now
create a wallet directory at the specified location (containing a wallet.dat
data file, a db.log file, and database/log.?????????? files) instead of just
creating a data file at the path and storing log files in the parent
directory. This should make backing up wallets more straightforward than
before because the specified wallet path can just be directly archived without
having to look in the parent directory for transaction log files.

For backwards compatibility, wallet paths that are names of existing data files
in the `-walletdir` directory will continue to be accepted and interpreted the
same as before.

Low-level RPC changes
---------------------

- When digibyte is not started with any `-wallet=<path>` options, the name of
  the default wallet returned by `getwalletinfo` and `listwallets` RPCs is
  now the empty string `""` instead of `"wallet.dat"`. If digibyte is started
  with any `-wallet=<path>` options, there is no change in behavior, and the
  name of any wallet is just its `<path>` string.
- Passing an empty string (`""`) as the `address_type` parameter to
  `getnewaddress`, `getrawchangeaddress`, `addmultisigaddress`,
  `fundrawtransaction` RPCs is now an error. Previously, this would fall back
  to using the default address type. It is still possible to pass null or leave
  the parameter unset to use the default address type.

- Bare multisig outputs to our keys are no longer automatically treated as
  incoming payments. As this feature was only available for multisig outputs for
  which you had all private keys in your wallet, there was generally no use for
  them compared to single-key schemes. Furthermore, no address format for such
  outputs is defined, and wallet software can't easily send to it. These outputs
  will no longer show up in `listtransactions`, `listunspent`, or contribute to
  your balance, unless they are explicitly watched (using `importaddress` or
  `importmulti` with hex script argument). `signrawtransaction*` also still
  works for them.

### Logging

- The log timestamp format is now ISO 8601 (e.g. "2018-02-28T12:34:56Z").

- When running digibyted with `-debug` but without `-daemon`, logging to stdout
  is now the default behavior. Setting `-printtoconsole=1` no longer implicitly
  disables logging to debug.log. Instead, logging to file can be explicitly disabled
  by setting `-debuglogfile=0`.

Miner block size removed
------------------------

The `-blockmaxsize` option for miners to limit their blocks' sizes was
deprecated in V0.15.1, and has now been removed. Miners should use the
`-blockmaxweight` option if they want to limit the weight of their blocks'
weights.

Python Support
--------------

Support for Python 2 has been discontinued for all test files and tools.
=======
`listtransactions` label support
--------------------------------

The `listtransactions` RPC `account` parameter which was deprecated in 0.17.0
and renamed to `dummy` has been un-deprecated and renamed again to `label`.

When digibyte is configured with the `-deprecatedrpc=accounts` setting, specifying
a label/account/dummy argument will return both outgoing and incoming
transactions. Without the `-deprecatedrpc=accounts` setting, it will only return
incoming transactions (because it used to be possible to create transactions
spending from specific accounts, but this is no longer possible with labels).

When `-deprecatedrpc=accounts` is set, it's possible to pass the empty string ""
to list transactions that don't have any label. Without
`-deprecatedrpc=accounts`, passing the empty string is an error because returning
only non-labeled transactions is not generally useful behavior and can cause
confusion.
